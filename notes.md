From tutorial series "Learn to Create WordPress Themes by Building 10 Projects" by Eduonix
Ref: https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-to-create-wordpress-themes-by-building-10-projects/

Includes:
* Ink framework v 3.1.10 https://github.com/sapo/Ink/releases/download/3.1.10/ink-3.1.10.zip

## Lesson 68) Ink HTML Template 
Made an HTML template based upon the "Carousel" Ink framework example from https://ink.sapo.pt/cookbook/.
NOTE: This template uses dummy images from lorempixel.com, which is no longer operable, resulting in many "borken image" icons.

## Lesson 69) WPNews Theme Setup & Menu
Created theme with index.php and style.css.  Added screenshot.png.  Added support in functions.php for primary menu.
Extracted head.php, header.php and footer.php partial templates.

## Lesson 70) Main Post Loop
Add support for post thumbnails along with a custom image size.  Convert the static "Recent Posts" to dynamic, using a post loop
